## Introduction
In this machine learning project, we are going to be implementing the Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) in order to get predictions respectively. We see that there are a lot of Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) being deployed in various settings. Getting an overview of the networks would ensure that we understand the basics before understanding their working in real-time projects respectively.

We would be using different kernel sizes and this would give us a good indication of the change in the output values based on the predictions respectively.
